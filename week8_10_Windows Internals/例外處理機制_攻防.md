- The Structured Exception Handling (SEH) is a protection mechanism to prevent the buffer overflows. 
- SEH uses a linked list as it contains a sequence of data ..

- [Interrupt Affinity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/interrupt-affinity-and-priority)
  -  The affinity of an interrupt is the set of processors that can service the interrupt. 
  -  Each device has an affinity policy. 
  -  The operating system uses the affinity policy to compute the affinity for that device's interrupts. 
  -  The affinity policy can be specified in the device's INF file or registry settings.
  -  Starting with Windows Vista, administrators can use the registry to set an affinity policy for an interrupt.

- [Controller Objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-controller-objects)
- a controller object usually represents a physical device controller with attached devices. 
- A lowest-level non-WDM driver for a set of similar devices coordinated by a physical controller can create a controller object and use it to synchronize I/O operations between the attached devices. 
- The driver implements a ControllerControl routine and calls the I/O manager's controller object support routines.
