## addressing定址法: how to address the data in memory
- Sequential addressing
  - The instruction pointer (IP) register (IP for 32-bit systems and RIP for 64-bit) contains the address of the instruction following the one being currently executed. 
  - The instruction pointer is set to the next instruction automatically by the CPU.

- Direct addressing
  - address to be directly included in the instruction is an operand. 
  - 範例 call/jmp. 
  - Most of Windows, executables are loaded at address 0x00400000 with the first section, which is by default the code section being loaded at address 0x00401000
  - The register call, where the target address is stored in a register:
    - lea rax, [my_proc]
    - call rax
  
  - Via an immediate address
  - Via an address stored in a register

- Indirect addressing
 - the address is somewhere in there, but is not used directly. 
 - Instead, it is referenced by a pointer, which may be a register or certain base address (immediate address)
   - Via an address pointed by immediate
   - Via an address pointed by a register
- Base relative addressing
   - Base + index
   - Base + index * scale
- IP/RIP-based addressing
- Far pointers
